In Python, a function is a block of code that performs a specific task. Functions in Python are used to make the code modular, reusable, and easier to read.
A function can take input parameters, process them, and then return the output.

Here's an example of a simple function in Python:

def greet(name):
    print("Hello, " + name + ". How are you?")
In this example, we define a function called greet that takes one parameter called name. The function then prints a greeting message with the name provided.

To use this function, we can call it with an argument like this:

greet("John")
This will output:


Hello, John. How are you?
In addition to input parameters, functions can also have output values using the return statement. For example:


def add_numbers(a, b):
    result = a + b
    return result
This function takes two input parameters a and b, adds them together, and then returns the result. We can call this function like this:

sum = add_numbers(5, 3)
print(sum)
This will output:

8
Functions can also have default parameter values and variable-length arguments.
Python has many built-in functions, but you can also define your own functions to perform specific tasks in your code.
