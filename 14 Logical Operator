In Python, logical operators are used to evaluate Boolean expressions.
They are used to combine two or more conditions or values to produce a single Boolean value (either True or False) based on the truth values of the operands.
The following are the logical operators in Python:

and: The and operator returns True if both operands are true, otherwise it returns False.
Example:

x = 5
y = 10
if x > 0 and y < 15:
    print("Both conditions are true")
or: The or operator returns True if at least one of the operands is true, otherwise it returns False.
Example:

x = 5
y = 10
if x > 0 or y > 15:
    print("At least one condition is true")
not: The not operator is a unary operator that returns the opposite of the Boolean value of its operand.
If the operand is True, not returns False, and if the operand is False, not returns True.
Example:

python
Copy code
x = 5
y = 10
if not(x < y):
    print("x is not less than y")
Note that the logical operators and and or use short-circuit evaluation.
That means that if the value of the first operand is enough to determine the result of the operation, the second operand is not evaluated.
This can be useful for optimizing code and avoiding unnecessary computations.
