In Python, a function is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task.
A math function is a built-in function in Python's math module that performs mathematical operations. Here are some commonly used math functions in Python:

abs(x): Returns the absolute value of a number.
round(x, n): Rounds a number to a specified number of decimal places.
pow(x, y): Raises x to the power of y.
sqrt(x): Returns the square root of a number.
log(x): Returns the natural logarithm (base e) of a number.
log10(x): Returns the base-10 logarithm of a number.
exp(x): Returns e raised to the power of x.
sin(x): Returns the sine of a number in radians.
cos(x): Returns the cosine of a number in radians.
tan(x): Returns the tangent of a number in radians.
To use these functions, you first need to import the math module using the import keyword. For example, to use the sin function, you would write:

import math

x = 1.0
y = math.sin(x)
print(y)
This code would print the sine of 1.0 radians to the console. Note that the math module must be imported before the functions can be used.
