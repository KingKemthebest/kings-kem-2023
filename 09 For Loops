In Python, a for loop is a way to iterate over a sequence of items, such as a list, tuple, or string, and execute a block of code for each item in the sequence.

Here is the basic syntax for a for loop in Python:

for item in sequence:
    # code to be executed for each item
In this example, item is a variable that will take on the value of each item in the sequence for each iteration of the loop.
The indented block of code following the for statement will be executed once for each item in the sequence.

Here is an example that demonstrates how to use a for loop to iterate over a list of numbers and print each one:

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for num in numbers:
    print(num)
Output:

1
2
3
4
5
You can also use the range() function to generate a sequence of numbers to iterate over.
For example, to iterate over the numbers from 1 to 10, you can use the following code:

for num in range(1, 11):
    print(num)
Output:

1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
You can also use a for loop with a conditional statement to filter the items in a sequence.
For example, to print only the even numbers from a list of numbers, you can use the following code:

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for num in numbers:
    if num % 2 == 0:
        print(num)
Output:

2
4
