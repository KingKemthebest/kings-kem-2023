In Python, user input is a way of getting information from a user through the keyboard.
It is a built-in function called input(). The input() function waits for the user to type some text and press the "Enter" key.
Once the user presses "Enter," the text they typed is returned as a string.

Here is an example of using the input() function to get the user's name:

name = input("What is your name? ")
print("Hello, " + name + "!")
In this example, the input() function displays the message "What is your name?" to the user and waits for them to type their name.
Once they press "Enter," the name variable is assigned the value of the text they typed, and then a greeting message is displayed using the print() function.

Note that the input() function always returns a string, so if you need to perform calculations or comparisons with the user's input, you may need to convert it
to the appropriate data type using functions like int() or float().
