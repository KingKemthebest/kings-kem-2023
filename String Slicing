In Python, string slicing is a method of extracting a portion (a substring) of a string by specifying a range of indices.

The syntax for string slicing is as follows:

string[start:end:step]
start represents the starting index (inclusive) of the slice. If omitted, the slice starts from the beginning of the string (i.e., index 0).
end represents the ending index (exclusive) of the slice. If omitted, the slice ends at the end of the string (i.e., the index of the last character + 1).
step represents the step size (i.e., the number of characters to skip between each character in the slice). If omitted, the default value is 1.
Here are some examples:

# create a string
s = "Hello, World!"

# extract the first 5 characters
print(s[:5])   # output: "Hello"

# extract the 7th to the 12th character
print(s[7:13]) # output: "World!"

# extract every other character
print(s[::2])  # output: "Hlo ol!"
Note that string slicing does not modify the original string; it creates a new string that contains the extracted substring.
