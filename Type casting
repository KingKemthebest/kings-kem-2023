Type casting, also known as type conversion, is the process of converting one data type into another data type in Python.

In Python, there are several built-in functions that can be used for type casting. Here are some examples:

int() - This function is used to convert a value to an integer data type.
float() - This function is used to convert a value to a floating-point data type.
str() - This function is used to convert a value to a string data type.
bool() - This function is used to convert a value to a Boolean data type.
Here's an example of using type casting in Python:


# Converting a string to an integer
string_number = "123"
integer_number = int(string_number)
print(integer_number)   # Output: 123

# Converting a float to an integer
float_number = 3.14
integer_number = int(float_number)
print(integer_number)   # Output: 3

# Converting an integer to a string
integer_number = 123
string_number = str(integer_number)
print(string_number)    # Output: "123"

# Converting a non-zero value to a boolean
some_value = 10
boolean_value = bool(some_value)
print(boolean_value)    # Output: True

# Converting a zero value to a boolean
zero_value = 0
boolean_value = bool(zero_value)
print(boolean_value)    # Output: False
Note that not all type conversions are possible in Python. For example, you cannot convert a string that contains non-numeric characters to an integer or float.
In such cases, a ValueError will be raised.
